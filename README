Instruction: 

* Download the sac files using SOD, with Patty's xml template.
* Copy all the files to the folder one level above your downloaded sac files
* Change the eventid in recread_sac2eventmat.m, modify the filters if necessary
* Run recread_sac2eventmat.m, it will generate a mat file: "eventid".mat
* Modify the phases you want to have in the cheatsheet in plot_recread.m. If the phase you interested is not in the database, use make_phasedb.m to add it.
* Load the matfile and then run plot_recread.m

Command list can be found in command_list.txt

TIP: You must restart your matlab if you plug or unplug a monitor to your computer.
TIP: You can use run_taupsetsac.csh to change the phases in the cheat sheet if you have taup in your machine. Run this before you run recread_eventmat.m

Enjoy!
